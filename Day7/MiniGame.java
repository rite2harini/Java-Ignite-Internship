/*
ADVANCED 2 – Mini Game Character System

Create a class GameCharacter:

Attributes:
name

Requirements:
Constructor using this
Proper encapsulation
Methods:
attack(GameCharacter enemy)
heal()
showStats()
Rules:
attack reduces enemy health
heal increases own health
health should never be accessed directly
Twist:

Each attack should show:
